    "description": "SM4 Encryption tool is a tool used for encrypting and decrypting data. It uses the SM4 algorithm and supports two encryption modes: ECB and CBC. It can encrypt the input data and output the encrypted result. Additionally, the tool supports multiple input and output formats, including Hex, Base64, and Utf8. Users can choose different input and output formats, encryption modes, and padding methods to meet different encryption needs.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. Supports multiple input and output formats: The tool supports multiple input and output formats, including Hex, Base64, and Utf8.\n\n2. Supports ECB and CBC encryption modes: The tool supports ECB and CBC encryption modes, and users can choose different encryption modes as needed.\n\n3. Supports padding methods: The tool supports padding methods, and users can choose whether to pad the data.\n\n4. Supports file encryption: The tool supports file encryption, and users can choose the file to be encrypted and output the encrypted result.\n\nUse cases:\n\n1. Data encryption: During data transmission, data needs to be encrypted to ensure its security. Using the SM4 Encryption tool, data can be encrypted, and different encryption modes and padding methods can be selected to meet different encryption needs.\n\n2. File encryption: During file transmission, files need to be encrypted to ensure their security. Using the SM4 Encryption tool, users can choose the file to be encrypted and output the encrypted result.\n\n3. Data decryption: During data transmission, data needs to be decrypted to ensure its security. Using the SM4 Encryption tool, encrypted data can be decrypted, and different input and output formats can be selected to meet different decryption needs.",
