    "description": "Tool Name: Extract Public Key from RSA Private Key\n\nTool Function: Extracts the public key from an RSA private key\n\nUse Case: When using the RSA encryption algorithm, sometimes it is necessary to convert a private key to a public key. This tool can easily convert an RSA private key to a public key for use in the encryption and decryption process.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Copy and paste or input the RSA private key into the tool.\n\n2. Enter the password for the private key (if any).\n\n3. Click the \"Extract Public Key\" button.\n\n4. The tool will automatically extract the RSA public key and display it in the output area.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The private key must be in PEM format.\n\n2. If the private key is password-protected, the password must be entered to extract the public key.\n\n3. The process of extracting the public key may take some time, depending on the length of the private key and the computer's performance.\n\n4. The process of extracting the public key is done locally and will not upload the private key to a server.\n\n5. The tool only supports the RSA encryption algorithm and does not support other encryption algorithms.\n\n6. The tool only extracts the public key and does not modify or operate on the private key in any way.\n\n7. When using this tool, please ensure the security of the private key and avoid any potential leaks.",
