    "description": "AES Encryption Tool is a tool used for encrypting and decrypting text. It uses the AES algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text, and supports multiple encryption modes and padding methods.\n\nFeatures:\n\n1. Supports text encryption and decryption: Users can input the text that needs to be encrypted or decrypted, and select the appropriate encryption mode and padding method.\n\n2. Supports multiple encryption modes: AES Encryption Tool supports multiple encryption modes such as ECB, CBC, CFB, CTR, and OFB. Users can select the appropriate encryption mode as needed.\n\n3. Supports multiple padding methods: AES Encryption Tool supports multiple padding methods such as Pkcs7, Zero, Iso10126, None, and Ansix923. Users can select the appropriate padding method as needed.\n\n4. Supports password and offset settings: Users can set the password and offset used for encryption and decryption to ensure data security.\n\n5. Supports file encryption and decryption: Users can select to encrypt or decrypt a file, and save the encrypted or decrypted file locally.\n\nUse cases:\n\n1. Data encryption: During data transmission or storage, data needs to be encrypted to ensure data security. AES Encryption Tool can help users quickly encrypt data and select the appropriate encryption mode and padding method.\n\n2. Data decryption: After receiving encrypted data, it needs to be decrypted. AES Encryption Tool can help users quickly decrypt data and select the appropriate encryption mode and padding method.\n\n3. File encryption: When files need to be encrypted, AES Encryption Tool can help users quickly encrypt files and select the appropriate encryption mode and padding method.\n\n4. File decryption: When encrypted files need to be decrypted, AES Encryption Tool can help users quickly decrypt files and select the appropriate encryption mode and padding method.",
